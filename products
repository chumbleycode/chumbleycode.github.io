# STAR

Situation: Needed to ask whether SES predicts changes in the number of cell types.
Task: how to infer this from mRNA data (not cell counts and not absolute).
Action: Despite many normalizations I concluded that the closest answerable question concerns cell type distributions (relative). 
Result: The compositional tools used are now used in every paper from the consortium.
