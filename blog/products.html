# STAR

Situation: Needed to ask whether SES predicts changes in the number of cell types.
Task: how to infer this from mRNA data (not cell counts and not absolute).
Action: Despite many normalizations I concluded that the closest answerable question concerns cell type distributions (relative). I experimented with Dirichlet regression, but settled on compositional regression.
Result: The compositional tools used are now used in every paper from the consortium.

Give an example of how you deal with conflict?
Context: bugs in code -> efficiency consequences. Ask verbally to fix. Forget or ignore or deprioritize. Frustration.
Action: start using github issues, start defensive programming (unit testing).
Result: much fewer issues, junior colleagues are driven to learn new problem solving skills.
